QwkWeb
======

QwkWeb parses QWK message archive packets, loads into a database, and presents
a web-based browsing interface. QwkWeb is derived from ZQWK, a Zope-based
implementation that targeted Zope 2.7 in 2003. This version contains:

* qwk.py, a QWK library in Python.
* qwkweb.py, a web-based interface built using the web.py framework.
* Templates for the web interface.
